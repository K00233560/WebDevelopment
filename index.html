                          <p>The fiddle is the most commonly played instrument in traditional Irish music. Here are a number of reasons why the fiddle is a good starting point for learning trad:
                        </p>    
                           
                            <ul>
                                <li>A fiddle can be bought at a reasonably cheap price </li>
                                <li>Fiddles are light-weight, and easy to hold and transport
                                </li>
                                <li> It is relatively easy to learn with a little practice
                                </li>
                                <li>The fiddle has a range of octaves and is suitable for many types/ styles of tunes - i.e. it is suitable for most types of tunes â€“ fast/ up-beat tunes and slow melancholic tunes
                                </li>
